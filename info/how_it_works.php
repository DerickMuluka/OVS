        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>The Online Voting System is designed to ensure a smooth, secure, and transparent voting process. Below is a step-by-step guide on how the system works:</p>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>1. Registration</h3>
                <p>To participate in the voting process, you must first register. Provide your valid details, including name, student ID, and email address, to create an account. After registration, you will receive a confirmation email with a link to verify your account.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>2. Login</h3>
                <p>Once registered, you can log in using your student ID and password. Upon successful login, you will be redirected to the voter dashboard, where you can access the voting system.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>3. Voting</h3>
                <p>In the voting section, you will see a list of available positions and the candidates contesting for each. Select your preferred candidate for each position. You can only vote once per position, and your choices are final after submission.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>4. Results</h3>
                <p>After the voting period ends, the system automatically tallies the votes. The results are then published on the platform, showing the winner for each position. In case of a tie, the system will notify you, and the appropriate steps will be taken.</p>
